## Overview

MTN implimentation of CIS module with allowance for changing versions.

## Module Description

Applys configuration and tests for CIS benchmark from http://cisecurity.org/
Initially reimpliments V1.0.0 and developed to impliment V2.1.1

Supports use of Hieradata, and params.pp class.
uses Added execute control functionality from `bossbear/cis_benchmarks` and  rule_specialperms.pp (and matching rule_specialperms hash in common.yaml) where one can add any extra hashes (file/dir: permission) to enforce permissions on files or directories

CIS benchmark versions supported by OS

| OS | versions |
|----|----------|
| redhat | 1.0.0, 2.10 |


## Setup
clone the module:
    git clone http://github.com/abuxton/cis_benchmarks
    or
    puppet module install abuxton-cis_benchmarks

(See Usage below for staging dependent modules)

### What cis_benchmarks affects

main list of subsystems impacted:
* sshd (and anything that requires authentication)
* auditd
* cron
* grub
* su
* kernel parameters
* network parameters
* selinux


### Setup Requirements **OPTIONAL**

Currently, this module requires 4 additional modules:

1. puppetlabs-stdlib
2. herculesteam-augeasproviders_core
2. herculesteam-augeasproviders_pam
3. fiddyspence-sysctl

### Beginning with cis_benchmarks

Once you've cloned it you can run it two ways:

1. Stage all dependent modules in fixtures and run against spec/fixtures/modules directory.  Following the below steps as root:

        cd cis_benchmarks
        bundle install --path vendor/bundle
        bundle exec rake spec_prep  #this will populate spec/fixtures/modules dir.
        puppet apply -v --modulepath spec/fixtures/modules examples/init.pp
2. Manually stage the dependent modules and run against /etc/puppetlabs/code/environments/production/modules directory:

      puppet module install puppetlabs-stdlib
      puppet module install herculesteam-augeasproviders_core
      puppet module install herculesteam-augeasproviders_pam
      puppet module install fiddyspence-sysctl
      cd cis_benchmarks
      puppet apply -v --modulepath /etc/puppetlabs/code/environments/production/modules examples/init.pp

Obviously, you can add --noop flag to run things in an audit mode.

In order to run RSpec testing run the following commands:

    cd cis_benchmarks
    bundle install --path vendor/path
    bundle exec rake spec

In order to run beaker testing run the following commands:

    cd cis_benchmarks
    bundle install --path vendor/path
    bundle exec rake beaker:centos-7-x86_64-docker

## Usage

Strongly suggest profiling the module with trlinkin/noop  

##Reference


## Beaker Testing - Puppet 5

For Puppet Master/Agent Setup

* export `BEAKER_TESTMODE=agent`
* export `BEAKER_PUPPET_COLLECTION=puppet5`
* export `BEAKER_PUPPET_AGENT_VERSION=5.3.1`
* export `PUPPET_INSTALL_TYPE=foss` #It seems like this cannot be read from the nodeset file

For Puppet Apply Setup

* export `BEAKER_TESTMODE=apply`
* export `BEAKER_PUPPET_COLLECTION=puppet5`
* export `BEAKER_PUPPET_AGENT_VERSION=5.3.1`
* export `PUPPET_INSTALL_TYPE=foss` #It seems like this cannot be read from the nodeset file



* run provisioning `BEAKER_destroy=no BEAKER_debug=yes bundle exec rspec spec/acceptance`
* run provisioning with existing vms `BEAKER_provision=no BEAKER_destroy=no BEAKER_debug=yes bundle exec rspec spec/acceptance`

## Limitations

This module was tested using Puppet Agent 4.7 and have been tested on following systems:
1. RedHat 7 x64
2. CentOS 7 x64

#### firewall
The module will test for components and deploy certain packages but it does not enforce iptables or firewalld rules we suggest puppetlabs/firewall for those tasks



## Development

Since your module is awesome, other users will want to play with it. Let them know what the ground rules for contributing are.
TODO
----

RHEL6 support
Tidy up custom facts currently does not support changing script dir or missing scripts well
